 Blockchain:
 ===========
  Collection of blocks that store information in digital format. Each block has 3 main fields.
   1. Address of the block determined by hash. 2. Data field. 3. Prev Hash which is reference to the previous block.
   
  'Genesis Block' is the 1st block in blockchain. Since it is 1st, previous hash field is all 0 and cannot use this block in your application.
  Blocks are added by miners. Whichever miner is fast, can add the block to blockchain.
  
  Why do they add block ?
   They get reward in cryptocurrency for the transaction by who initiated it. This reward is also known as 'Gas Fee'.
  Since mining takes time, transactions using butcoin/etherium are not as fast as traditional transactions.
  
  How does it prevent hacking ?
   If a block is modified by a hacker, it's hash is changed. This causes the block to be invalidated since it does not match the value of prev hash in next block.
   Since blockchain is decentralised platform, hacker will also not have cpu and mining power to modify all the blocks.
  
  It is immutable, i.e if a block is written, it cannot be changed. It's openly available. 
  Each crypto has separate blockchain. If another crypto is reusing a blockchain, we call it a token not cryptocurrency. 
  
 Smart Contracts :
 =================
  Programs stored on blockchain that run on predetermined conditions. Eg: NFT marketplace, any store accepting crypto currency, crypto swap etc,.
  
  Etherium block chain is the most popular. Frontend can be written with react. Backend with node.js/python. 
  Smart contracts can be written using solidity which can be used in Etherium, polygon and Binance blockchain. Rust, C, C++ can be used to write Solana.
  Frontend/Backend communicate to Smart contract(solidity) using API's. APIs can be web 3 js, python or ethers.
  GraphQL is used to fetch data from blockchain.
  For local development, use Hardhat for Js and Brownie for Python.
  Storage in blockchain is mostly images, which can be large therefore it is stored in IPFS.
  
  Amazon Managed Blockchain is a solution provided by AWS.
